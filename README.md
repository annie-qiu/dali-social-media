DALI Developer Challenge 22S - Social Media Frontend Challenge

[deployed url](https://dali-net.netlify.app)

I used React, Redux, Firebase, and Chakra UI to create a social media platform for DALI. I used Firebase for users to log in or sign up. The members are generated with the JSON file. When you create a new account, the account information is stored in Firebase, and you can edit your profile and post to the feed. I started used the given JSON file to populate the members page, so right now when you create an account, your profile doesn't show up in the members page. If I were to continue on the project, I would have your profile appear on the People page. When you create a new post, the platform has your post appear in the Feed with your account showing as the post's author. I started adding a feature to like posts, and I was working on having the platform know if you liked a post before, but I wasn't able to get this function fully working, so right now you can like and unlike, but if you refresh the page you can add more likes. The user and post states are stored in Redux. 

I based this project upon the starterpack repository I created for CS52.
